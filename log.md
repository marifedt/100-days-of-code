# 100 Days Of Code - Log

<!-- ### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 1)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: May 05, Friday

**Today's Progress**: I've started the Twitter Sidebar Clone Project.

**Thoughts** I've been studying React Concepts and I struggled on deciding where could I start applying those concepts. Then I decided to do this project. I'm looking forward to learn a lot of new things in the process.

### Day 2: May 06, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Continued to learn React

**Thoughts** I'm still struggling on getting familiar with React Components. I didn't have much time today to code so I decided to continue to understand about the Event handlers inside a Component, passing that Event handler from a Parent to a Children component. Then I started the concept about State which I needed to continue for the project.

## Day 3: May 07, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Getting familiar with Leetcode (Solved 2 problems - from beginner's guide)

**Thoughts** I was working half of the day so I only had time during the nights. I was a bit tired so I decided to get familiar with Leetcode during this time. Time complexity and Space complexity are the things mentioned when I reviewed the problems so I would take the time to learn about it.

- [Root Equals Sum of Children](https://leetcode.com/problems/root-equals-sum-of-children/)

## Day 4: May 08, Monday

**Today's Progress** : Took a break from coding to organize my school courses

**Thoughts** I decided to relax before the week starts because school starts again.

## Day 5: May 09, Tuesday

**Today's Progress** : Spent my time learning about React State and Time Complexity

**Thoughts** I started to follow through with FreeCodeCamp's React course because I am struggling with following through with the React's documentation on their website. I also solved problems on Leetcode today to continue the beginner's guide.

## Day 6: May 10, Wednesday

**Today's Progress** : 
- Learned about Mockaroo and how that helps to generate substantial data to work with testing a Web service. 
- I learned about ThunderClient.
- A little bit about Python because of my Data structures class

**Thoughts** ThunderClient is a good tool especially when you want to save time and opt not to work on the interface while still able to test the routes of what you're building. I can't wait to build out different web services.

## Day 7: May 11, Thursday

**Today's Progress** :
- Continued with the twitter sidebar clone
  - Added Profile component
  - Used ES6 class syntax for the React component

**Thoughts** I didn't have much time to code today because of my classes. Still, I had fun applying what I learned from the freeCodeCamp's React course.

## Day 8: May 12, Friday

**Today's Progress** :
- Learned to use codespaces on GitHub
- Python Basics 
  - Dictionaries
  - Traversing through a `list` and counting the occurences of an element
  - Basic Types and Variables
  - Iteration
- Microsoft Project LinkedIn Learning Course
- Read about JavaScript Promise

**Thoughts** I was at school the whole day doing exercises for each class and worked on labs. I had a lot of new concepts that are introduced to me and I'm pretty sure I won't remember every single thing. I'll continue on the upcoming days to try and apply these new learnings I got by doing. I had fun learning Python basics, I'm still not used to the syntax and I'm missing the brackets. ðŸ˜…

## Day 9: May 13, Saturday

**Today's Progress**:
- Continued to learn about Python
  - Conditional Execution
  - Functions

**Thoughts** It was a tiring day but I'm glad I was still able to make some progress with learning Python. I really needed it for my Data structures class.

## Day 10: May 14, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: It is a well spent break as I got the chance to celebrate Mother's day with my family.

**Thoughts** I really wanted to do something for today but we got home late and I didn't have the much needed energy to focus and sit in front of my computer.
