##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: May 05, Friday

**Today's Progress**: I've started the Twitter Sidebar Clone Project.

**Thoughts** I've been studying React Concepts and I struggled on deciding where could I start applying those concepts. Then I decided to do this project. I'm looking forward to learn a lot of new things in the process.

### Day 2: May 06, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Continued to learn React

**Thoughts** I'm still struggling on getting familiar with React Components. I didn't have much time today to code so I decided to continue to understand about the Event handlers inside a Component, passing that Event handler from a Parent to a Children component. Then I started the concept about State which I needed to continue for the project.
