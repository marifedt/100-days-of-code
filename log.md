# 100 Days Of Code - Log

<!-- ### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 1)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: May 05, Friday

**Today's Progress**: I've started the Twitter Sidebar Clone Project.

**Thoughts** I've been studying React Concepts and I struggled on deciding where could I start applying those concepts. Then I decided to do this project. I'm looking forward to learn a lot of new things in the process.

### Day 2: May 06, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Continued to learn React

**Thoughts** I'm still struggling on getting familiar with React Components. I didn't have much time today to code so I decided to continue to understand about the Event handlers inside a Component, passing that Event handler from a Parent to a Children component. Then I started the concept about State which I needed to continue for the project.

## Day 3: May 07, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Getting familiar with Leetcode (Solved 2 problems - from beginner's guide)

**Thoughts** I was working half of the day so I only had time during the nights. I was a bit tired so I decided to get familiar with Leetcode during this time. Time complexity and Space complexity are the things mentioned when I reviewed the problems so I would take the time to learn about it.

**Link(s) for Leetcode problems**
- [Running Sum of 1D Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/running-sum-of-1d-array/)
- [Root Equals Sum of Children](https://leetcode.com/problems/root-equals-sum-of-children/)

## Day 4: May 08, Monday

**Today's Progress** : Took a break from coding to organize my school courses

**Thoughts** I decided to relax before the week starts because school starts again.

## Day 5: May 09, Tuesday

**Today's Progress** : Spent my time learning about React State and Time Complexity

**Thoughts** I started to follow through with FreeCodeCamp's React course because I am struggling with following through with the React's documentation on their website. I also solved problems on Leetcode today to continue the beginner's guide.

- [Time Complexity](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/big-o-cheat-sheet-time-complexity-chart/)

## Day 6: May 10, Wednesday

**Today's Progress** : 
- Learned about Mockaroo and how that helps to generate substantial data to work with testing a Web service. 
- I learned about ThunderClient.
- A little bit about Python because of my Data structures class

**Thoughts** ThunderClient is a good tool especially when you want to save time and opt not to work on the interface while still able to test the routes of what you're building. I can't wait to build out different web services.

## Day 7: May 11, Thursday

**Today's Progress** :
- Continued with the twitter sidebar clone
  - Added Profile component
  - Used ES6 class syntax for the React component

**Thoughts** I didn't have much time to code today because of my classes. Still, I had fun applying what I learned from the freeCodeCamp's React course.

## Day 8: May 12, Friday

**Today's Progress** :
- Learned to use codespaces on GitHub
- Python Basics 
  - Dictionaries
  - Traversing through a `list` and counting the occurences of an element
  - Basic Types and Variables
  - Iteration
- Microsoft Project LinkedIn Learning Course
- Read about JavaScript Promise

**Thoughts** I was at school the whole day doing exercises for each class and worked on labs. I had a lot of new concepts that are introduced to me and I'm pretty sure I won't remember every single thing. I'll continue on the upcoming days to try and apply these new learnings I got by doing. I had fun learning Python basics, I'm still not used to the syntax and I'm missing the brackets. ðŸ˜…

## Day 9: May 13, Saturday

**Today's Progress**:
- Continued to learn about Python
  - Conditional Execution
  - Functions

**Thoughts** It was a tiring day but I'm glad I was still able to make some progress with learning Python. I really needed it for my Data structures class.

## Day 10: May 14, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: It is a well spent break as I got the chance to celebrate Mother's day with my family.

**Thoughts** I really wanted to do something for today but we got home late and I didn't have the much needed energy to focus and sit in front of my computer.

## Day 11: May 15, Monday

**Today's Progress** :
- String Functions: upper() and lower()
- Fibonacci Problem
- Python Classes

**Thoughts** I spent my time solving my python lab assignment that is why I focused on learning concepts about Python while I was trying to solve a problem. It makes me productive as I was applying the new things I've learned.

## Day 12: May 16, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**:
> It's React Day ðŸ˜Š

- Passing callback functions as Props to children components
- Lifecycles Methods (willMount, didMount, willUnmount)
- Event Listeners (and how I could put it in didMount and removing it on willUnmount)
- shouldComponentUpdate function that re-renders the component
- Readings for non-tech courses

**Thoughts** I've been really busy trying to balance my tech courses and non-tech courses (cause it is a research class) But hopefully I'll get past the hardest part soon so I could focus on tech for the most part. Anyway, I always like to learn new concepts about React since I find the new concepts cool and very useful.

## Day 13: May 17, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**:
- Finish Web API assignment that uses the sample data set of Mongo DB (trips)
- Solved LeetCode problems
- Understanding Algorithm Analysis

**Thoughts** TMI. I also need to do lots of readings to make my essay for my other non-tech class so I will have less time to do things related to tech for the next couple of days.

**About the API**:
- Routes:
  - Getting trips on page 2 and shows 10 trips on one page: `/api/trips?page=2&perPage=10`
  - Getting a single trip by Id: `/api/trips/572bb8222b288919b68abf5a`
  - Also exists are routes for Updating, Adding, and Deleting

- [Shortest Distance to Target String in a Circular Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-distance-to-target-string-in-a-circular-array/description/)

## Days 14-15: May 18-19, Thursday & Friday
**Progress**:
- Use Bootstrap for UI and make use of tester APIs to practice working with data using Fetch API.
- Linear Search and Binary search
- Difference of Waterfall vs Agile Project Management

**Link to Resource(s)**:
- [Agile Methodology](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/agile-methods-and-methodology-for-beginners/)

## Days 16-18: May 20-22, Saturday - Monday

**Progress**:
- Reviewed Algorithm Analysis (DSA)
    - read about Step count method
- Include a map using leaflet library
- Finished a simple UI for showing Trips
        - fetch data from the TripsAPI I prev. created.
- Factory Functions vs. Constructors

**Thoughts** I spent lots of time reading resources about Algo analysis and I feel like my understanding is not enough for me to explain it with others.

## Day 19: May 23, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**:
- Started a project that works with an existing news API
- Used Express for the server

**Thoughts**:
- The documentation of the API helped me to navigate the routes I could use for the request
- Although I can't host it cause I only used the developer version.

## Day 23: May 27, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Took a break since I have to focus on finishing my non-tech readings that I need for my course essay. 

**Thoughts** It's getting busier in the middle of the term so I badly needed the break after work.

## Day 24: May 28, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Reviewed about Time complexity by comparing different approaches of solution to the same problem. 

**Thoughts** Only had time to study after dinner since I had to work. Writing essays takes most of my time these days.
